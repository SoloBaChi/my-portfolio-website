/*
DATA TYPES:
**Data are the building blocks of any programming bc they help us organize information and determine how our programs will run
**Comments: comments are often by developers to help clarify the meaniing of your code, it is used to explain your code and makes thing clearer and as well improve code readability
**Strings:Strings can be any combination of characters -- letters, numbers and even emojis
You must use matching quotes at the beginning or end of the string -- otherwise JavaScript thinks you are referring to a variable. variables should have a descriptive name of what it represents
**Variables: with variables you no longer need to work with one-time-used data 
when we used var keyword, we create variables that can be used in our global scope
try to use variables that are accurate and succintly try to describe what the data is about
**Characters:Characters within a string are indexed starting from 0, where the first character is at position 0, to n-1, where the last character is at position n-1 (n represents the total number of characters within a string).
**Escaping Character tells JavaScript to ignore the character's special meaning and just use the literal value of the character
**Comparing String:When you compare strings, case matters,The ASCII values of [A-Z] fall in the range [65-90], whereas,the ASCII values of [a-z] fall in the range [97-122]0
**NOTE:you can not use "return" statement inside a forLoop for now
**Booleans:A boolean variable is mainly essential in evaluating the outcome of conditionals (comparisons). The result of a comparison is always a boolean variable
**In general cases (regular equality check), a true corresponds to number 1, whereas false represents a number 0. For example
**If you purposefully assign a value to nothing...null will be returned
**NULL refers to nothing while undefined refers to the absence of value
**
**LESSON THREE:CONDITIONALS
**What good is a data if you do not put it into use
NOTE:WHen you are writing code, the main goal is to solve a problem, the steps your code takes to solve a problem 
known as an AN ALGORITHM.
**FLOW CHART: this is a just a diagram for how to solve a problem.
**A flowchart is a visual diagram that outlines the solution to a problem through a series of logical statements. The order in which statements are evaluated and executed is called the control flow.
**If...else statements allow you to execute certain pieces of code based on a condition, or set of conditions, being met.
**Conditionals allows you to choose ehich to code run based on the result on an expression.
**In JavaScript we can represent complex problems by combining logical expressions with special operators called logical operators.
**By combining two boolean values together with a logical operator, you create a logical expression that returns another boolean value.
**Logical operators can be used to combine multiple conditional statements into a single statement.
**Truth tables can represent the possible combinations of inputs in a logical expression
